## Artist Statement

### Formal Qualities

This piece is an abstract clock/ time keeping device. It changes some aspect of itself any unit of time does. Each element that appear on the screen is reminiscent of a clock: dots represent the shape of a clock face (appear at each second passing), arrows the hands of a clock (appear at each minute passing), the “looping” agents mimic the movement of said hands by always turning clockwise (their number is determined by the date)  and the swinging circle (appears at each hour passing) resembles a grandfather clock’s pendulum. 

### Context

In this artwork, I wanted to explore the concept of the passage of time. Often, I feel like time goes by very fast and I do not get the opportunity to appreciate every passing moment. Thus, I wanted to create an artwork that immortalises every passing moment with a unique visual. Because changes in the piece over time are subtle, it also serves to show just how long  a second, minute, hour, etc. truly is. In addition, because so many parameters affect the way the piece looks, a person could view it multiple times throughout their lifetime and it would never look the same twice.
